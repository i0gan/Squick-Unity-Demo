The directory examples/ contains basic usage examples of the MySQL Connector/C++.

In order to compile and run them you must have a MySQL server installed. 
By default the examples will try to connect to a MySQL server on the host 
"127.0.0.1" at port "3306" using the username "root" and the password "root" 
to access the database "test". You can change the connection properties 
in example.h

Its possible to specify alternative connection parameters using command line
parameters: example_program tcp://<host>[:<port>] [username] [password] [database]
